# Remember Inspect Element

I hate pages with bright backgrounds or too many popups and I also dislike using extensions in general out of paranoid mistrust, so I'm making my own thing to make my own changes to pages.

Initially it'll just record entire document and swap whatever is on page to it when set. Will break scripts and such, but I don't care as most pages I'm interested in are mostly text.

Not sure when I'll get this to work because I hate Javascript.
